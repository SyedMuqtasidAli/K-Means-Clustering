# Image Clustering with K-means

Welcome to the Image Clustering with K-means project! This project demonstrates the use of K-means clustering to segment an image into clusters. The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook named `Week2 Day3 Task2.ipynb`.

## Introduction
This project involves applying K-means clustering to an image to reduce its colors to a specified number of clusters. The clustering process simplifies the image by representing it with the mean color values of the clusters.

## About
In this project, we start with K values of 2, dividing the image into 2 clusters. Each pixel's color is reassigned to the mean value of its respective cluster, resulting in an image with only 2 colors.

## Installation
To get started with the Image Clustering with K-means project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-clustering-kmeans.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd image-clustering-kmeans
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the Image Clustering with K-means notebook, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (see Installation section).

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook "Week2 Day3 Task2.ipynb"
    ```

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load the image, apply K-means clustering, and visualize the results.
